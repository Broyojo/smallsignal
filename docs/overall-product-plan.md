# Current Product Architecture

A local-first schematic editor with netlist interchange and simulation
orchestration; humans and Agents edit one live Project through typed,
revision-checked operations. A Project persists circuit facts and simulation
source folders, never processes, prepared decks, receipts or results.

  ├─ typed Project edits → Edit Engine → Project / Documents / source folders

       → SimulationService ← immutable snapshot of selected authored input
       → configured executor / managed admission
       → ngspice + qualified models, or the hosted native VACASK candidate
       → parsed results / artifacts → UI and Agent

## Core invariants

- A Base Net owns physical membership; Logical Nets are derived. Net Labels,
  Ground, Global VDD and Power Rail naming share one owner-addressed marker
  system (local VDD Power uses the Cell-Pin owner); Power Rail is only a
  drawing gesture.
- Different supply names stay distinct; scope and hierarchy interfaces, not
  text equality, decide where a name connects.
- A Crossing is not a Junction: only explicit connect/snap changes topology.
  Movement preserves connectivity; explicit cut partitions it.
- Cell Pins are ordered interfaces; visual variants never drop terminals or
  invent MOS bulk connections.
- Runtime and portable schema versions follow the
  [file-format contract](specs/project-file-format.md). Cloud Save, portable
  export, browser recovery and Gallery publication are distinct operations.
- The author owns the Testbench; unsupported devices get located diagnostics,
  never guessed replacements.
- Circuit, File, Project and simulation operations share authorization without
  becoming competing mutation protocols.
- A save, a pretty drawing or an exit code does not establish electrical
  correctness.
