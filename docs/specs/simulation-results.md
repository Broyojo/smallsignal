# Simulation Numeric Results

Status: accepted

Owners: `packages/spice-run`, `packages/simulation-service`

[Setup and compilation](simulation.md) owns acquisitions; [execution](simulation-execution.md)
owns receipts and artifacts. Exact shapes:
[`result-data.ts`](../../packages/spice-run/src/result-data.ts),
[`result-schema.ts`](../../packages/spice-run/src/result-schema.ts).

## Result data

- `result.data` exposes captured native vectors without needing an Output
  binding. Prepared `signalNames` is run-local Canvas metadata; it never
  renames vectors or changes connectivity. No second evaluated waveform set,
  automatic measurement summary or device OP table for new runs.
- `SimulationResultData` version 1 has a non-empty `analyses` array, each with
  native plot name, probes and axis/value fields: `op` (`value`, `unit`),
  `dc` (declared `sweep` + equal-length values), `ac` (`frequencyHz`, `real`
  and `imag`; magnitude/phase is the consumer's job), `tran` (solver
  `timeSeconds`; plots are never resampled to share axes), `noise`
  (frequency, output and input-referred ASD, two integrals; input unit from
  the selected source).
- Records keep rawfile order; repeated analyses are never deduplicated.
  Optional `rawPlotOrdinals`/`rawPlots` map analyses to source records
  (ordinals are per rawfile). `quantity` is the simulator's word; `unit` the
  SI symbol or `null`. `data` is absent without a rawfile. It is distinct
  from the legacy `outputData` envelope, whose evaluated `analyses` new runs
  do not fill.
- Probes name existing objects plus hierarchy occurrence; the
  probe→vector mapping is made at compile time, never inferred from results.
- Vector spellings are exact identities: lookup, IDs, labels and CSV never
  case-fold (VACASK can return `Out` and `out`). Name normalization belongs to
  the source adapter. Physical AC acquisitions stay complex with units even
  when all imaginary parts are zero.

## Reading the rawfile

Numbers come from the ASCII rawfile, never console text.

- Points are split on blank lines and the count must equal `No. Points` (a
  fixed-line reader misreads complex files).
- `Flags: complex` means every value is `real,imaginary`; a real plot has no
  imaginary part, not zeros.
- The sweep column is the declared quantity; a 1-D DC plot uses its single
  `v-sweep`/`i-sweep`. No axis, or several DC axes, is refused.
- Several plots are read independently. Binary rawfiles are refused by name
  (`filetype=ascii`).
- ngspice `noise` = exactly one `Noise Spectral Density Curves` (`frequency`,
  `onoise_spectrum`, `inoise_spectrum`, amplitude per √Hz) plus one
  `Integrated Noise`; repeats keep raw evidence with a diagnostic, never
  guessed pairs. Unread plots are a `warning` by name, an `error` when alone.
  No supported analysis left → unusable.
- VACASK noise: native PSD kept; ASD = `sqrt(output PSD)` and
  `sqrt(output PSD / squared transfer)`; undefined referral is null, not 0.
  Integrals are trapezoidal RMS estimates over recorded samples
  (`integrationMethod: "trapezoidal-psd"`, labelled `sampled PSD`), no
  extrapolation, sorting or bridging; missing ones are absent (blank in CSV,
  omitted in GUI/MCP).
- `dims=1` short vectors in AC/DC/TRAN become the record's `scalars` (first
  value); padding is not sweep data. Undeclared constants stay waveforms;
  malformed dimensions are diagnostics.

No number is invented: missing or unusable values produce a diagnostic naming
the variable and line; nothing is padded, interpolated or carried forward.

| code                    | what the file did                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `empty-file`            | no rawfile content at all                             |
| `unsupported-format`    | a binary rawfile, or not a rawfile                    |
| `header-incomplete`     | ends before a plot is fully described                 |
| `header-invalid`        | a header line is unreadable or missing                |
| `variable-line-invalid` | a `Variables:` line declares no index, name, quantity |
| `point-block-invalid`   | a point has the wrong number of values, or no index   |
| `point-count-mismatch`  | recovered points disagree with `No. Points`           |
| `value-malformed`       | a value is not a number                               |
| `value-not-finite`      | a value is `nan`, `inf`, or an overflow               |

Checking that a requested vector exists is the caller's job.

## Run verdict

A reading is `{status: "read", data, diagnostics}` or
`{status: "unusable", diagnostics}` with at least one `error`; its
diagnostics join the run's. One pure evaluator in `@icm/spice-run` decides
the verdict for Worker, Agent, GUI and hosted checks:

- rawfile requested → `completed` needs a readable file with ≥ 1 supported
  analysis and its vectors; no rawfile → positive evidence ngspice accepted
  the deck (`Circuit:` banner or analysis output), not arbitrary stderr;
- a non-zero exit is diagnostic, not decisive, when all results arrived;
- ngspice's own error lines name and locate the cause, collapse duplicates
  and suppress the generic epilogue once a cause is known
  (`fixtures/ngspice-failures/` pins them).

Electrical qualification may add environment, probe and tolerance checks
without reclassifying the run. Hosted results with rawfile dimensions are
re-read by the canonical reader; missing data is never resurrected; archives
without dimension evidence must be rerun.

## Measurements

Console `meas`/`report_measurement` reports come only from the executed
include graph, keep Console order and are never associated with raw records
by name. Native `meas` enters the Spec report; raw scalars stay in raw
data/CSV. Optional `* @spec` (ngspice) / `// @spec` (VACASK) comments declare
limits, ranges or targets; the source adapter owns includes, sections and
names. One shared evaluator reads captured input only: missing/ambiguous
metrics are not evaluated, metrics without rules unconstrained
([Spec annotations](../agent/simulation-specs.md)). VACASK values without
rules use `source.kind: "log"` with declared units. Legacy JSON measurement
configuration stays readable but is not regenerated.

## CSV

`simulationAnalysisToCsv` is pure over one parsed analysis: op
`variable,value,unit`; dc sweep + values; ac `frequency [Hz]`, `re(<probe>)`,
`im(<probe>)` (never magnitude); tran `time [s]` over the run's own points.
Scalars follow in a separately headed table. Values are the shortest decimal
that round-trips. Files: `<analysis>-<record-index>.csv` per analysis,
`specs.csv` and `specs.json`; no `outputs-*.csv`, `measurements.csv` or OP
CSV for new runs. Unknown units stay unknown (`_db` is not a unit).

## Historical output compatibility

Archived outputs may carry `semantics` (`valueKind`, `quantity`, `origin`,
native `expression`) derived from the executed source snapshot, never from
editor text or name suffixes; archives without it and `outputs.json` stay
readable. Complex storage is no instruction to take magnitude; native `db`,
`ph`/`cph` and degree results are not transformed again; bounded inference
never runs ngspice. Plots, comparison and image export are not product
features.
